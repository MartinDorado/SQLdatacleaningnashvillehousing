As a data enthusiast, unable to share specific past SQL projects, I chose to utilize the renowned Nashville Housing dataset for a comprehensive data cleaning exercise. Following an exploratory data analysis, I embarked on the cleaning process.

The primary objective of this data cleaning endeavor is to significantly elevate data quality by rectifying issues such as inconsistent date formats, unifying categories within the 'Landuse' column, imputing missing values, decomposing address columns into granular components (address, city, state) for improved usability, standardizing values to eliminate redundant labels, and discarding superfluous columns.

Finally, I created a Stored Procedure to identify and select properties with exceptionally low prices. Additionally, I incorporated a parameter for the uniqueID column, enabling flexible filtering.
